# Hi there, I'm Grace ðŸ‘‹

## I'm a Full Stack Developer, CTO, and Tech Enthusiast ðŸ’»

I'm passionate about technology, leadership, public speaking, art, social service, and creativity. I was born and raised in Nepal and have a deep appreciation for culture and diversity. In addition to academics, I actively shape my identity through extracurricular activities. I love organizing events and see myself as a natural leader. 

I'm an advocate of communication and use my public speaking skills and interest in social sciences to connect with people from all walks of life. This helps me continue learning.

In 2019, I started my journey as a freelance developer and have since worked on projects for numerous clients. Due to my dedication and innovation, I now occupy an important developer role at CABTM NEPAL. As CTO of several companies, I've led teams to reach new technological heights.
